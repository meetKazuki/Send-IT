## Project Description
SendIT is a courier service that helps users deliver parcels to different destinations. SendIT provides courier quotes based on weight categories.

### Features
* Users can create an account and log in.

* Users can change the destination of a parcel delivery order.
* Users can cancel a parcel delivery order.

* Admin can change the *status* and *present location* of a parcel delivery order.

#### Hopeful features
1. The application should display a Google Map with Markers showing the *pickup location* and the *destination*.
2. The application should display computed travel distance and journey duration between the *pickup location* and the *destination* (leveraging Google Maps `Distance Matrix Service`).
3. The user gets real-time email notification when Admin changes the status of their parcel.
4. The user gets real-time email notification when Admin changes the present location of their parcel.
